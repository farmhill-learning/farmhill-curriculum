# Mathematics
This section contains the approach to math teaching at farm hill, across grades starting from preschool to 12th grade. 

## the approach
At the very broad level, we expect the students to think like mathematicians when they do math. While we do focus on content, methods and techniques, we would really like them to see the patterns around them and make sense.
